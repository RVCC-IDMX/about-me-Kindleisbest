            <p>
                I grew up in California. I was always intrested in computers and stuff like that. With Apple computers (such as ipad, iphone, mac, etc) I am a software beta tester. What that means? I am testing the operating system since iOS/iPadOS 16. In contrast we are 1 month away from iOS 19 that will go into beta phase at WWDC25 on June 9th so that is pretty much 3 years. I also beta test some apps. Right now I am testin a few microsoft apps, spodify, google chrome, and more apps I wont go into details into. I've even taken apart and repaired my own laptop from time to time. even my laptop the laptop I repare is my experamental computer. What I do is I try to other operating systems, take apart my laptop to see what ticked where, and I even beta tested windows.

                        I think an important part of a website is website animations. Especially CSS Animations because css animations are simple enough where you can learn pretty fast. Unlike JavaScript which is an entirely different language. Animations can help users have a better experience. All though they are not per say required but some animations can go a long way though.
Animations can go a long way for your website. There are benefits to it. A benefit  would be “In web design, employing animation as a means of storytelling is an immensely powerful tool. It possesses the ability to captivate your audience and convey your message with a depth that static images or text alone cannot accomplish”(Nam Le Thanh). The quote is saying that animations help paint a picture that with just text you can't do. It's relevant because this helps your website stand out than other website and not like a sore thumb unless your bad at animations. Animations can help even get more people on your website. The very same article said “Enhancing the vitality of your website, animation is a valuable tool that fosters visitor engagement and leaves a lasting impression” (Nam Le Thanh). This quotes talk about how animations can draw people to your website. Its important because if you pour effort into a website you probably want people come to your website. In conclusion you want animations in your website to help gain traffic.
Why should I choose css animations over JavaScript? CSS is generally easier than JavaScript. According to MDN Web Docs “They're easy to use for basic animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript”(MDN Web Docs). This quote talks about how you can easily implement them without knowing Javascript. Its important because for those getting into the web development game that might not know Java still can make their website look nice. Also CSS animations can run better than JavaScript. In the same article they wrote “The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible”(MDN Web Docs). This quote is talking about how CSS Animations can run under medium loads and renders more smoothly. Its important because along side better animations you also want to make sure that they work optimally and efficiently. So to conclude you want CSS Animations over JavaScript because its easier to implement and it works little better.
So what is CSS Animations in particular? They are as what the name might imply animations that is coded in whats called Cascading Style Sheets. According to W3 Schools “An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another”(W3 Schools). This quote is describing what an animation is. So pretty much knowing what it is can help know what CSS Animation is. In the same article it mentions “To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation”(W3 Schools). This quote explain how keyframes is the way that CSS Animations work. So in conclusion the quotes pretty much went over what and how CSS Animation work
So basically in my opinion CSS Animations are the way to go. Especially since they are easy to implement and that you can be creative with it. Also people will probably enjoy the cool animations you put in. Animations in general can go a long ways with your general audience. This is why I prefer CSS Animations over other animations and prefer it over not having any animations at all. The animations I have thats purely css is the hover effects for the desktop version. And using a tiny bit of JavaScript and a lot of CSS Animation is the entirety of the nav bar.
