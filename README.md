# Name
Andrew Emad Nashed

## HTML and CSS

I Used HTML and CSS 99% of the website. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language and CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. I used a line or 2 of javascript only for the Nav Bar.

## IDE & Hosting

I used VSCode for the IDE and for extentions the one I used the most for this is Live Server to preview the website before commiting the changes. I also put the commits through Netlify to host my website to the internet
