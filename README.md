# Name
Andrew Emad Nashed

## HTML and CSS

I Used HTML and CSS 99% of the website. HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language and CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. I used a line or 2 of javascript only for the Nav Bar.

## IDE & Hosting

I used VSCode for the IDE and for extentions the one I used the most for this is Live Server to preview the website before commiting the changes. I also put the commits through Netlify to host my website to the internet. [GitHub](https://github.com/RVCC-IDMX/about-me-Kindleisbest)link



## Description 
I worked on a website pretty much highliting good things to know about me. How I did it was that step by step I went from all the assignments and try to make it unique to my style. I used AI to help debug what could of been the problem and I refered to a few websites such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) or [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) just as refrences if I was unsure about something. So basically my website consists of Web Dev title, logo, pictures, info about me, blog entry, snipits of code, a video, a contact form, and social media links. I have Professor Steven Caruso to thank since he helped out explaining the code to me. Also the 3 images in the Gallery are AI generated.
